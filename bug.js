The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated.  This can happen if you're attempting to read data from a snapshot inside an asynchronous callback before the asynchronous operation that fetched the snapshot has completed. For example:

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then(doc => {
  console.log(doc.data().myField); // Error: myField might not exist yet
});
```

This code might throw an error because `doc.data()` might be null or undefined until the asynchronous operation completes. This happens because the data is fetched asynchronously from the Firebase server, so it takes time before the data is available in the snapshot.
